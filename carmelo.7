.TH resume 7 "27 Nov 2022" "1.0" "Carmelo Califano's Resume"
.SH NAME
Carmelo Califano's \- Resume
.SH SYNOPSIS
25 years supporting Telecom and IT clients worldwide. No routing, switching, BGP, OSPF, pretty please... my domains are infrastructure, servers, virtualization, operating systems, identity and access management (IAM), authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA), complex software applications and the data flows that feed them.
Above all, SECURITY, in the wider sense. Systemic security goes beyond protecting the perimeter with firewalls and IPSs. Application/cloud security comes from automation, IaC, supply chain analysis, redundancy, compliance, treating your apps/servers as disposable entities (the "pet vs. cattle" metaphor), active monitoring, remediation, and more.
